        <h1>Welcome to my project!</h1>
        <p>This website showcases my project for the course "Data Visualization.".</p>
        <p>This project utilizes GeoJSON to present an interactive map of Europe. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a dynamic map that allows them to explore and obtain essential information about European countries.</p>
        <p>As you navigate the map and click any country, you will discover a wealth of basic data including population, area, birth rate, death rate, and life expectancy. This feature offers a convenient way to access key socio-economic and demographic indicators for each country.</p>
        <p>To further enhance your exploration, the project incorporates a graphical bar chart representation. This dynamic chart visually depicts the population ratio of countries within the automatically loaded region based on the selected country. By examining the chart, you can easily compare the population sizes of various countries within the same region.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the project also provides a display of the birth-to-death ratio specific to the chosen country. This ratio provides insights into the country's demographic trends, offering a deeper understanding of its population dynamics.</p>
        <p>Overall, this project aims to deliver an engaging and informative experience, enabling users to delve into the map of Europe and gain valuable insights into the population, demographics, and socio-economic aspects of each country. Enjoy your exploration!</p>
